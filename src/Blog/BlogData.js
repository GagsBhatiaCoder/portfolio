    title: "Adopting JSX While Prioritizing User Experience",
    content:
      "Keeping up with the latest developments in frontend architecture can be challenging, especially with a codebase the size and age of Etsy’s. It’s difficult to balance the benefits of adopting newer tools with the cost of migrating to them. When a total rewrite isn’t possible, how can you ensure that old patterns can coexist with new ones, without totally sacrificing user and developer experience, or loading so much additional code that it harms frontend performance. We’ve developed a frontend architecture that we think is an effective, pragmatic compromise. We render static HTML using PHP by default, while giving developers the ability to opt into using “component islands”: self-contained, server-side rendered JSX components used only where complex interactivity is needed.",

    title: "Unraveling the Facebook Data Dilemma: Is Your Information Truly Sold?",
    content:
      "In recent years, concerns have mounted about the privacy and security of user data on Facebook, leading many to question if the social media giant sells user information. While Facebook does utilize targeted advertising based on user preferences, it explicitly states that it does not sell individual user data to third parties. Instead, advertisers are provided with aggregated and anonymized data to tailor their campaigns. However, the fine line between personalized ads and data privacy remains a topic of scrutiny. Users are encouraged to stay vigilant about privacy settings and understand the nuanced dynamics of data usage in the ever-evolving digital landscape.",
